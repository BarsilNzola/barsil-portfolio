	<p><strong>Here is a list of some of the projects I have created.</strong></p>
		<div class="list"
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Hello-world</strong>; This was the first project I did using HTML when we started learning at <a href="http://moringaschool.com/"><em>Moringa School.</em></a>. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/BarsilNzola/hello-world"><strong>link</strong></a> to the project.</li>

			<li><strong>cookie-recipe</strong>; We got to clone a cookie recipe repo that had poor identation and spacing in its <abrr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abrr> code. The task was to edit it properly. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/BarsilNzola/cookie-recipe"><strong>link</strong></a>.</li>

			<li><strong>initial-webpage</strong>; I created my first sample webpage using HTML and styling the page using CSS. I got to learn how to add images and links to texts. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/BarsilNzola/initial-webpage"><strong>link</strong></a>.</li>

	<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
	<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
	<ol>
		<li><p><strong>Education</strong></p><p>I finished high school in 2011 at <a href="https://stanthonysboysktl.sc.ke/"><strong>St. Anthony's Boys High School Kitale.</strong></a> I attained an A- of 78 points.</p><p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.laikipia.ac.ke/"><strong>Laikipia University</strong></a> in 2016 with second class honors (upper division) having taken <span class="style">Bsc. Economics and Statistics</span>.</p></li>

		<li><p><strong>Job Experience</strong></p><p>I worked as an Economics and statistics officer attache in the county government of Trans-Nzoia under the Ministry of Economic Planning, Commerce and Industry. Some of the tasks that I undertook were; conducting capacity building on micro and small enterprises, carrying out monitoring and evaluation on all projects of the county and preparing project progress reports</p></li>

		<li><p>I decided to join <a href="http://moringaschool.com/"><em>Moringa School.</em></a> to learn coding. I have been passionate about it but never got the chance to actually learn it, and from what I heard Moringa was the best unlike the learning I did on my own from Google that didn't help much. This will also give me a chance to be well equiped for the job market.</p></li>
