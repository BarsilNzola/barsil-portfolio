	<p>Here is a list of some of the projects I have created.</p>
		<div class="list"
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Hello-world</strong>; This was the first project I did using HTML when we started learning at <a href="http://moringaschool.com/"><em>Moringa School.</em></a>. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/BarsilNzola/hello-world"><strong>link</strong></a> to the project.</li>

			<li><strong>cookie-recipe</strong>; We got to clone a cookie recipe repo that had poor identation and spacing in its HTML code. The task was to edit it properly. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/BarsilNzola/cookie-recipe"><strong>link</strong></a>.

			<li><strong>initial-webpage</strong>; I created my first sample webpage using HTML and styling the page using CSS. I got to learn how to add images and links to texts. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/BarsilNzola/initial-webpage"><strong>link</strong></a>.
